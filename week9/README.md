# A python implementation of Kmeans algorithm, saving every point move in separate graphic.

## To run the algorithm with normalized data:
`python kmeans.py -k n -dataset normal.txt`

## To run the algorithm with unbalanced data:
`python kmeans.py -k n -dataset unbalance.txt`

`-k` - the number of centroids we would like to have
